# Deal Galaxy - Amazon.in Affiliate Deals Web Application

## Project Overview

Deal Galaxy is a production-ready Amazon.in affiliate-deals web application designed to provide users with live deal tracking, price monitoring, and affiliate link generation. The application consists of a robust backend microservice for data scraping and a modern frontend interface for user interaction.

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Requirements

The backend is implemented as a standalone Node.js microservice with the following specifications:

**Core Technologies:**
- Node.js runtime environment
- Web scraping framework: Puppeteer, Playwright, or Selenium
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Authentication: Traditional email/password system

**Database Schema Requirements:**
- Users table: User authentication and profile data
- DealsCache table: Cached deal information with timestamps
- TrackedProducts table: User-specific product tracking
- BlogPosts table: Content management for blog section

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/deals?limit=&offset=`: Returns JSON with live deals including fetchedAt timestamp and deals array
- `POST /api/track`: Accepts Amazon URL or keyword, returns real-time data including current price, image, and metadata
- `GET /api/track/:userId`: Returns tracked products for a specific user

**Scraping Requirements:**
- Real-time data extraction from Amazon.in
- Proxy rotation using robust free-proxy providers
- Retry and error handling mechanisms
- Latency optimization to meet user-defined thresholds
- Data extraction: titles, prices, images, discounts, search suggestions
- CORS headers for frontend consumption

### Frontend Requirements

The frontend is built using modern web technologies with specific design requirements:

**Core Technologies:**
- React framework
- Tailwind CSS for styling

   - Card content: image, title, price, discount badge
   - Interactive buttons: [Copy Link], [Buy Now] with affiliate tag
   - Hover effects: lift and shine animations
   - "Last fetched" timestamp display

4. **Price Tracker:**
